# Philosophers

## Goal of the project

Philosophers is a project involving threads in C language. It relies on a well-known CS problem called "The dining philosophers problem" by Djikstra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem). 

The goal is quite simple : A given number of philosophers are gathered around a table. There is an infinite quantity of pasta located at the center of the table. Every philosopher need to eat, then need to sleep. No philosopher should starve, and they cannot communicate with each other. Moreover, there is only one fork per philosophers and one philosopher needs two forks to be able to eat. A philosopher can only access the fork located at his right and the fork located at his left.  

More detailled information about the project can be found on the PDF.
